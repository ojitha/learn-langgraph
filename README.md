# LangGraph Studio example

For the basic configuration please check https://ojitha.github.io/ai/langchain/langgraph/2025/09/05/LangGraph_studio_v2.html.

This project is using Jupyter notebook at the same time LangGrap Studio is support. That is why agents module is created. 

> Module must have `__init__.py` file such as `agents/example1/__init__.py`
